# House Price Prediction API

## üìå What is this project?
This is a Flask-based API that predicts house prices using a pre-trained model. Given input features such as location, size, and number of rooms, the API returns an estimated house price.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation
To set up the project, clone this repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ashdev-7/house-price-api.git
cd house-price-api

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Running the API
Run the Flask server with:
```bash
python server.py
```
By default, the API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Making Predictions
Send a POST request with house details to get the predicted price:
exmaple :
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sqft": 1500, "bedrooms": 3, "bathrooms": 2, "location": "New York"}'
```
Response:
```json
{
  "predicted_price": 350000
}
```
